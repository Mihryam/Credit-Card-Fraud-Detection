# Introduction

In today's fast-paced and digital world, credit card fraud is a growing concern for both consumers and financial institutions. Every year, millions of dollars are lost due to fraudulent credit card transactions. To combat this issue, machine learning algorithms can be utilized to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. In this project, I will explore various machine learning algorithms that can be employed for credit card fraud detection. Through this project, I aim to create a robust and accurate model that can detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, and compare the differnt results from the model.

# Problem Definition and Algorithm
Credit card fraud detection is a fascinating problem due to its constantly evolving nature and high stakes. Innovative solutions using machine learning algorithms are needed to stay ahead of fraudsters and protect consumers and businesses in real-time. In this project , the data used was posed with high imbalance as the Normal transactions were more than the Fraudulent Transactions. I had to strategize a way to make the models learn what Normal transactions looked like and correctly classify the fraudulent transactions.
##
The data had 31 columns and 284807 rows, with juat 492 of them being fraudulent and the rest Normal Transactions.
The algorithms used are Logistic Regresssion, K- Means, and Auto Encoders. I will be comparing differnt results of the model
